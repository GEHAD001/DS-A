## About

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning resource for Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in TypeScript. It provides practical implementations of various data structures and algorithmic concepts.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript for type-safe code implementation
- Bun as JavaScript runtime
- Node.js ecosystem

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version)
- Bun runtime
- TypeScript

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd DS-A
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized using a numbered folder structure for easy navigation:

### Data Structures ([01] - [09])

Each data structure folder contains:

- **[01] Implementation**: Different implementations of the data structure
- **[02] Common Problems**: Practical problems solved using the data structure

### Algorithms ([10] - [30])

- Contains various algorithm implementations
- Each algorithm folder includes problems that can be solved using that specific algorithm

### Utility Functions ([99])

- Contains helper functions and utilities
- Miscellaneous implementations

## Usage

To run any implementation or problem solution:

```bash
bun run [file-path]
```

Example:

```bash
bun run DS&A/[01] Stack/[01] Implementations/StackDLL.ts
```
